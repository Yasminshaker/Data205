The Following Project explores the environmental health of Montgomery County. Using a data set that showcases all the illegal dumping activity data set, the file "illegadal. Rmd" shows all the code I used to read in the data set, cleaning it, making graphs, and a map. It uses data from the Data Montgomery site. This data set is updated daily. 

Here is the link https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Environment/Illegal-Dumping-Activity/d985-d2ak 

The file "water.csv" shows all the code used to look through the water data set I was provided with by the DEP of Montgomery County. There is also the CSV file I used to test the data is uploaded as "water.csv"

The file "airquality.csv" shows all the code used to work through the air quality data from the EPA site. Note that the data is read using a function. 

Lastly, "Weather.csv" uses data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and is updated monthly.

There is also a Word document that is my data story for this project, and the initial project plan.
