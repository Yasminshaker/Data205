Montgomery County's Environment Project 

The Montgomery county's environment Project explores the environmental health of Montgomery County, and looks for trends in the air quality, water quality, weather temperatures, and illegal dumping cases.  

"illegadal. Rmd" shows all the code I used to read in the data set, cleaning it, making graphs, and a map. It uses data from the Data Montgomery site. 
Here is the link https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Environment/Illegal-Dumping-Activity/d985-d2ak 

"water.Rmd" - all the code used to work (including data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and statistical testing) through the water data set I was provided with by the DEP of Montgomery County. There is also the CSV file I used to test the data is uploaded as "water.csv"

"airquality.Rmd" -  all the code used to work through the air quality data from the EPA site. Note that the data is read using a function. This file shows all the code used for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and statistical testing. 

"Weather.Rmd" uses data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and is updated monthly, this file shows all the code used for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and statistical testing. 

There is also a Word document that is my data story for this project.
